      <description>2/15 - I found a new dataset that would allow me to have “A new machine learning approach to classifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)”. I sent an email to Mr. Writer requesting him to provide feedback on it and see if it was good for our purposes. He said that he would check it out and get back to me in a few days.</description>

      <description>3/1 - Received email reply from Sara Hosseinzadeh Kassani regarding the C-NMC Dataset.
“Regarding your inquiries, i) the dataset is severely skewed in ALL cases; you definitely need to do some data augmentation or provide external cases. ii) the results of applying deep architectures have the issue of underfitting; therefore, extracting features from deep architectures and using machine learning classifiers might resolve this issue. Iii) no specific pre-processing steps are needed as the dataset is already pre-processed by the challenge providers.</description>
