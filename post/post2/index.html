<p>“Regarding your inquiries, i) the dataset is severely skewed in ALL cases; you definitely need to do some data augmentation or provide external cases. ii) the results of applying deep architectures have the issue of underfitting; therefore, extracting features from deep architectures and using machine learning classifiers might resolve this issue. Iii) no specific pre-processing steps are needed as the dataset is already pre-processed by the challenge providers.”</p>
<p>I sent a followup email asking about unique approaches that I can take and the pitfalls of past research.</p>
<p>3/1 - Created an account on the Codalab competition website to allow me to do final dataset testing. Have not entered the competition yet. <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20395#results">https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20395#results</a></p>
<p>3/6 - Found 4 Github sites from researchers that worked with the ALL dataset:
<a href="https://github.com/jprellberg/isbi2019cancer">https://github.com/jprellberg/isbi2019cancer</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Elwyslan/ISBI-2019-Cells-Classification">https://github.com/Elwyslan/ISBI-2019-Cells-Classification</a>

<a href="https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/ALL-Classifiers-2019">https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/ALL-Classifiers-2019</a></p>
<p>3/7 - Found a few-shot learning tutorial video from a friend at Carnegie Mellon who recommended it and used it before. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgtf4d9zHHO8YjSSkkBT55XN8xsIvb-ku">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgtf4d9zHHO8YjSSkkBT55XN8xsIvb-ku</a>
<a href="https://github.com/wangshusen/DeepLearning">https://github.com/wangshusen/DeepLearning</a></p>
<p>3/8 - Received email from researcher Atmika Honnalgere regarding the ALL dataset. She sent a link to her entire model that was sent for the final testing. &ldquo;Classification of Normal Versus Malignant Cells in B-ALL White Blood Cancer Microscopic Images&rdquo;, in which it explains the VGG16 neural networking model</p>
<p>“Sorry for the late response. It has been a while since I worked on the project. I was with the MIG lab at IISc for only a short while, and I haven&rsquo;t pursued the work any further.
This is the submission I sent for the final test set. I hope it can be of some help. Apart from these, I think we have described our methodology in the paper itself.

<p>3/8 - MEETING NOTES:
Send followup emails to researchers regarding the unique approach and try getting Zoom meetings
Video presentation due as soon as possible (use requirements)
Big overview of science in the field (past 20ish years)
Classical science approach taken prior to machine learning
Machine learning methods on the dataset now
Drawbacks on the dataset and what problems are there with current machine learning methods
How is my method unique
Solidify scientific question and hypothesis</p>
<p>3/9 - Created presentation outline with some minor information filled in about traditional classification methods and what the researchers have conveyed to me.</p>
<p>3/9 - Started writing background information from all the research papers. I note down the problem they are solving, the model that they used, what unique things they are doing and how they are doing it, and any other important augmentation or ML techniques. Completed basic background research for 4 out of 11 papers and also noted down some points about why few shot learning would push science forward.</p>
<p>3/10 - Completed basic background research for 8 out of 11 papers and updated presentation.
3/11 - Found one more Github website from research papers while doing background research for the video presentation.
<a href="https://github.com/YongshengPan/ISBI-NMC">https://github.com/YongshengPan/ISBI-NMC</a> (Neighborhood Correction Model)</p>
<p>3/12 - Completed basic background research for all 11 papers and updated presentation</p>
<p>3/13 - Completed presentation and added basic learning requirements and just need to record video now.</p>
<p>3/15 - Finished recording video presentation and uploaded it into Google Drive folder. I also signed up for a Signature 2 meeting with Mr. Writer on March 17th at 8:15 A.M.</p>
<p>3/17 - MEETING NOTES:
Need to discuss data preprocessing. If it&rsquo;s already been done, what kind of preprocessing has been done. Give details.
Record new video with just the data processing.
Make Github account and set up Jupyter Lab</p>
<p>3/17 - Finished recording data preprocessing video presentation and uploaded it into Google Drive folder.</p>
<p>3/20 - Completed setting up a Github account and Jupyter Notebook environment on my device.</p>
<p>3/22 - Created a Coursera account, but have NOT started the course yet. Waiting for go ahead.</p>
<p>3/29 - Enrolled for Coursera “Mathematics for Machine Learning” course.</p>
